# Harp-Bootstrap Starter
A rapid prototyping tool using Harp.js and Twitter Bootstrap.

Harp.js can be a really cool tool for rapid prototyping, or simply some wireframing. That's how I use it at least.

This is a tool I built for myself so I can easily make wireframes for clients.

## Requirements

This project recommends using Yarn:

```
yarn
```
This will install all NPM packages. Alternatively, you can use:
```
npm install
```


## How To Use

```
yarn start
```

### For Rapid Protopyping

First clone the repository to your working directory
```
git clone https://github.com/PochoLabs/Harp-Bootstrap-Starter.git
```
Move into that directory
```
cd Harp-Bootstrap-Starter
```
If you already the packages installed, run:
```
yarn start
```

### Compiling

Once your are done, you might like to use the compiled files for whatever reasons (WordPress theme, Drupal theme, Meteor, Static Site server, etc). To get that output simply run the command:
```
yarn run compile
```
This will generate a `/www` folder in your directory where the compile and minified html, css, and JavaScript will be.
